# iFlow Memory

This file contains persistent memory for the iFlow orchestrator.

## CI Baseline
- Workflow runs have been analyzed and show both successes and failures.
- The "iFlow - Orchestrator+ (Innovate)" workflow is the most complex and has had recent issues.

## Improvement Areas
1. CI Optimization
2. Experimental Workflows
3. Documentation
4. Dependency Management
5. Innovation

## Implementation Plan
1. Create experimental workflows for testing new CI strategies
2. Refactor existing workflows to use reusable components
3. Add caching to speed up builds
4. Implement documentation improvements
5. Set up automated dependency updates
6. Create composite actions for common tasks
7. Validate changes with trial runs
8. Measure and report CI time improvements
9. Update policies and memory with learnings
